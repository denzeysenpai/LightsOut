[collider breakdown] << Collider Behavior

Colliders are Controls that represent the perspective and distance between a player and a wall.
Colliders are triggered whenever it intersects with a wall.

Each collider represent different areas of the render screen and each level of depth (colliders that
are nearer to the player will display a brighter color to simulate an illusion of depth) will have different
shades of color


List<PictureBox> col = new List<PictureBox>() {c1, c2, c3, c4, c5};

Color Depth1 = Color.FromArgb(); // brightest color  || for c1.Bounds.Intersect == true   || col[0]
Color Depth2 = Color.FromArgb(); // bright color     || for c2.Bounds.Intersect == true   || col[1]
Color Depth3 = Color.FromArgb(); // medium color     || for c3.Bounds.Intersect == true   || col[2]
Color Depth4 = Color.FromArgb(); // dark color       || for c4.Bounds.Intersect == true   || col[3]
Color Depth5 = Color.FromArgb(); // darkest color    || for c5.Bounds.Intersect == true   || col[4]

Collider Methods and their Purpose/Functionality, Description and FLow of Process


Colliders.SetColliders --> FixBreaking --> GetFace --> ArrangeColliderMethod --> ArrangeColliderSet --> ArrangeColliders

Tracker --> SetCollidersToStick --> StickToControl --> FixBreaking

MovementForColliders --> SetColliderView --> ColliderForView


SetColliders:
	Sets given controls to a list to be called later



FixBreaking:
	Arranges the Colliders first before any other process.
	If collider distance between the player is greater than load in distance during movement, 
	then pull colliders towards player 



GetFace:
	Private method for FixBreaking, returns a string that corresponds with where the player is facing



ArrangeColliderMethod:
	Provides values to place in the parameters of the ArrangeColliderSet method



ArranegColliderSet:
	Arranges the colliders by placing values passed by the previous method but now loops the code in order to set all colliders



ArrangeColliders:
	Arranges the colliders depending on the given values by the previous methods. This includes knowing which side
	the collider is at from the player even if the player's direction changes. Applies adjustments and rearranges
	the colliders whenever the player rotates 90 degrees.



Tracker:
	Tracks the positions of the colliders and detects if the colliders are starting to break off from the group
	or moving away from the player.



SetCollidersToStick:
	Summary: Acts like a glue for the colliders to the player.



StickToControl:
	Method for keeping the colliders together (regardless of the player location, so just basically is responsible
	for the distance between colliders only)
